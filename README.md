A downstream fork of
**[Nitrooxyde/Mellow-LLL-Plus-Canonical](https://github.com/Nitrooxyde/Mellow-LLL-Plus-Canonical)**
that adds an **automatic load / unload pipeline** for a **toolchanger** — six
buffers feeding six toolheads, one lane per tool, no splitter.

Upstream built the buffer firmware and host control layer this is based on, and
did the hard work of proving the concept. It deliberately withdrew its automatic
load/unload pipeline. This fork puts one back, because the reasons it was
withdrawn do not apply to this machine — see
[Why this fork can do what upstream withdrew](#why-this-fork-can-do-what-upstream-withdrew).
Mostly I'm experimenting with features that are very dependent on my current platform.

> **Nothing in this fork has run on hardware yet.** Every distance, duration
> and threshold in the load/unload pipeline is a commented placeholder. The
> firmware has not even been compiled — it builds only on a Klipper host.
> Treat this as a design under construction, not a release.

## Features

- [x] Autonomous in-firmware auto-feed (inherited from upstream)
- [x] Board runs as a standard Klipper USB MCU (inherited)
- [x] External Feed/Retract buttons on PA2/PA3, handled in firmware so they
      keep working with Klipper down
- [x] Mellow MDM module connected on PA4/PA5 — presence event plus a free-running
      encoder pulse counter in `lll_state`
- [x] Protocol version handshake — a mismatched host/firmware pair refuses to
      start instead of silently misparsing
- [x] Three-phase pulsed load (push, assist, handoff)
- [x] Sensor-driven unload with an MDM-measured final margin
- [x] MDM/Roadrunner differential monitoring across the long bowden
- [x] Hardware-agnostic `[buffer_manager]` section behind a backend seam
- [x] English throughout (upstream is French)
- [ ] **Validated on hardware — nothing past this line is proven**
- [ ] Firmware compiled
- [ ] Feed rates, distances and thresholds measured
- [ ] `mdm_mm_per_count` confirmed against the Roadrunner
- [ ] Second backend (e.g. BTT EBB42) — the seam exists, no implementation

## TODO

- Bench everything. See the Verification section of
  [docs/PORT_RUNBOOK.md](docs/PORT_RUNBOOK.md).
- Confirm the PB12/PB13 board-level pull-up assumption with a multimeter. The
  external buttons on PA2/PA3 enable an internal pull-up and the internal pair
  does not; that asymmetry is inherited from the old fork and inferred, never
  measured.
- Confirm MDM presence polarity (assumed active-low) once it is wired.
- Measure real forward and back feed rates. `assist_speed` is currently
  inherited from an unrelated probe move and is almost certainly too slow.
- Decide whether `differential_action` graduates from `warn` to `error`.
- Document the mcu-updater flow properly once settled.

## Hardware

```
Filamentalist V3 rewinder -> buffer -> MDM (on the buffer arm)
    -> long reverse bowden -> Roadrunner -> short bowden
    -> Extruder -> toolhead switch -> hotend
```

| Part | Role |
|---|---|
| [Filamentalist V3](https://github.com/Carrot-collective/Filamentalist_Rewinder/tree/main/Filamentalist_FV3_Rewinder) | Passive rewinder — takes back retracted filament |
| Mellow FLY LLL Buffer Plus | Buffer and feed motor; runs this firmware |
| Mellow MDM | Encoder module on the buffer arm — presence and motion |
| [Roadrunner](https://github.com/EiNSTeiN-/roadrunner-filament-sensor/) | High-resolution filament sensor before the extruder |
| Toolhead switch | Plain switch after the extruder gear |

**The MDM and the Roadrunner bracket the long bowden**, which is most of the
path. That is the point: comparing them reveals filament moving at one end but
not the other — buckling *inside* the bowden, which neither sensor can see on
its own.

Whichever sensor the filament tip has **not yet passed** is the one that can
still measure it. That single idea drives the whole design — the MDM measures
the early load and the late unload, the Roadrunner measures the middle.

### MDM encoder scale

The MDM ships three printable encoder disks. The published "minimum detection
distance" is travel per **full segment cycle**, and the firmware counts **both**
edges — so one count is half that figure:

| Disk | Vendor distance | Edges/rev | `mdm_mm_per_count` |
|---|---|---|---|
| 3-segment | 5.8 mm | 6 | 2.90 mm |
| 5-segment *(installed)* | 3.5 mm | 10 | **1.75 mm** |
| 10-segment | 1.73 mm | 20 | 0.865 mm |

Segments times distance is constant at about 17.4 mm — the filament travel per
disk revolution, which cross-checks the reading. **Do not enter the vendor
figure directly**; that makes every MDM distance read twice too long.

## Why this fork can do what upstream withdrew

Upstream shelved its automatic pipeline citing three things: no toolhead
cutter, no passive respoolers, and fragility across a splitter/merger. Their
prototype needed two sensors *plus* a measured detector-to-splitter distance —
"that single distance is the whole calibration."

This machine differs on all three:

- **No splitter.** Six lanes, six toolheads, 1:1. The post-splitter detector
  and the calibrated tail do not exist here, and the calibration goes with
  them.
- **Passive respoolers present.** The Filamentalist V3 is precisely the
  missing equipment upstream named.
- **The cutter concern is defused, not solved.** A mushroomed tip still forms,
  but it only ever travels back up its own dedicated path and never negotiates
  a merger junction, which is one reason to introduce unreliable loads. On a
  toolchanger, when you have only one filament path per toolhead and loading/unloading
  actions are manually managed this is not the same type of concern.

In upstream's own words: *"If your setup has a toolhead cutter and passive
rewinders, the automatic path is realistic with what this repo ships."*

## How the load pipeline works

| Phase | What happens | Measured by |
|---|---|---|
| **A — push** | Buffer jogs in short bounded pulses. Pulsed on purpose: a continuous push overshoots and buckles at any unguided gap. Cold-safe. | **MDM only** — filament has not reached the Roadrunner yet |
| **B — assist** | Extruder pulls while the buffer keeps pushing, until the toolhead switch confirms the gear grabbed. Needs heat. | Roadrunner, plus the differential check |
| **C — handoff** | Buffer returns to firmware autonomy; `loaded_gcode` runs. | — |

Unload reverses it: optional tip shaping (there is no cutter), a synchronized
retract until the toolhead switch and then the Roadrunner clear, and a final
margin measured with the **MDM** — because once the tip passes the Roadrunner,
nothing threads its wheel and it can no longer measure anything.

Loading is refused unless the lane's own extruder is Klipper's **active**
extruder, so a docked tool can never be driven by mistake.

## Changes to upstream

- `inform` (PA2/PA3 outputs signalling a non-Klipper mainboard) **deleted** —
  redundant under Klipper, which already receives `EV_BUTTON`.
- PA2/PA3 reclaimed as **external Feed/Retract buttons**, feeding the same
  firmware state machine as the internal pair.
- PA4/PA5 reclaimed as the **MDM module**. Both retired IOEXT channel pairs
  become permanently-refusing holes, so channel indices stay a stable contract
  for anyone's existing config.
- `lll_state` extended with `mdm_present`, `mdm_count` and `proto`.
- New host module `klippy/extras/buffer_manager.py` — the load/unload pipeline,
  behind a backend seam so the board can change later.
- Comments and user-facing strings translated to English.

Byte-identical parity with upstream is **not** a goal. `upstream/main` is kept
as a remote-tracking branch for reading their diffs and porting deliberately,
rather than for merging.

## Install & update

Firmware is **not** built in this repo. `src/buffer.c` is copied into a Klipper
tree on the Klipper host (a Raspberry Pi) and built there — see
[CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for the exact commands, and upstream's Installation
section below for the one-time Katapult bootloader setup, which is unchanged.

Updates on this machine go through **mcu-updater** rather than the
`install.sh` / `uninstall.sh` scripts upstream ships. Those scripts are left in
the tree for now but are not the supported path here.

Target: STM32F072, 8 KiB bootloader offset (application address `0x8002000`,
must match Katapult), 8 MHz crystal, USB on PA11/PA12.

## The bigger picture — multicolor with just buffers

This firmware is one brick of a larger goal: **multicolor / multi-material
printing on a single direct-drive toolhead without a selector MMU** — no
ERCF, no BoxTurtle, no AMS. One LLL Plus buffer per filament lane, a passive
splitter, Klipper orchestrating lane roles. Two lanes ran in production on
the reference setup, including real prints with color changes; a fully
automatic load/unload pipeline was prototyped end-to-end and worked, then
was withdrawn — held back by missing *equipment* (toolhead cutter, passive
respoolers), not by the concept.

## What's new — "Canonical v1, runtime-toggleable" (v1.0.0 of this repo)

The autonomous smart-buffer core is **unchanged** (same hall conventions, same TMC2208 `VACTUAL` drive, same feed behaviour, buttons included) — with one deliberate exception: after a hard MCU reset, autonomous feeding waits for the host or 20 s (safety fix #9, see [Known behaviour](#known-behaviour--limitations)). Everything below is added **on top**:

- **11 runtime-toggleable functions** (`LLL_ENABLE`): FEED, BUTTONS, MBSIG, ENTRANCE, TMC, MOVE, DIAG, LED, ADC, TELEM, IOEXT — **one flash**, everything selectable at runtime. No more rebuilding to change behaviour.
- **Roles per lane**: `active` / `parked` / `standby`. A parked lane **never auto-feeds forward** (multi-lane safety) but still follows a rewind; standby is fully frozen. `LLL_SET_IDLE` is kept as a backwards-compatible alias.
- **4 feed automation levels**: `auto` / `semi_auto` (one cycle per `LLL_ARM`) / `semi_manual` / `manual`.
- **Bounded motion only**: `LLL_JOG` (hard-limited to 10 s in firmware) and `LLL_RUN` (deadline, refreshable). **No unbounded motion order exists in the command set.**
- **Runtime tuning** (`LLL_SET`): feed/back timeouts, TMC current, microsteps, stealthChop, telemetry mask… persisted and replayed at every boot. **Named profiles** per lane (`LLL_PROFILE_SAVE / LOAD / LIST / DELETE`).
- **Telemetry events** (`lll_event` push) with a configurable `event_gcode` hook — react to jams / runout / diag edges from printer.cfg in ~20–50 ms instead of waiting for a poll.
- **IOEXT**: a 12-channel, **index-only** GPIO/PWM/ADC register for the spare connectors — critical pins are *not in the table*, hence physically unreachable; unverified pins are gated behind `LLL_UNLOCK`.
- **Filament identity & probing**: `LLL_FILAMENT` (type / color / temp / Spoolman spool) and `LLL_DETECT_LOADED` (detects which lane is physically engaged in the extruder using only the buffer arm sensors).
- **Multi-lane, N-scalable**: one `[mcu]` + one `[lll_buffer]` section per board — every G-code command is multiplexed by `LANE=`. The dashboard auto-discovers new lanes.
- **Web dashboard** (optional): a single self-contained HTML page shown inside Mainsail as an iframe webcam card, with a VCR-style per-lane transport. See [Dashboard & UI](#dashboard--ui).

## Why this exists

The official Mellow firmware is **standalone**: the buffer auto-feeds on its own but the board does **not** talk Klipper (no USB MCU; runout has to go through a separate signal wire).

The community Klipper integrations ([river29](https://github.com/river29/Mellow-LLLBufferPLUS-klipper), [ss1gohan13](https://github.com/ss1gohan13/BufferPLUS-klipper)) flash **stock Klipper** and re-implement the buffer with **host-side g-code macros**. That works, but feed bursts go through the **g-code queue** (latency, can lag during long `G1 E` moves) and they switch the active extruder, which can **misdirect extrusion during a print**.

This project runs the buffer state machine **inside the MCU firmware** as a Klipper task — zero g-code-queue latency, no active-extruder juggling, can't stall a print — while the host gets a **full command surface** on top.

| | Standalone (Mellow) | Stock Klipper + host macros | **This firmware** |
|---|---|---|---|
| Auto-feed | ✅ in-firmware | ⚠️ host macros (queue latency) | ✅ **in-firmware** |
| Klipper MCU / USB sensor | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ |
| Risk of disrupting a print | n/a | ⚠️ `ACTIVATE_EXTRUDER` | ✅ none |
| Runout → print pause | signal wire | USB (PB7) | USB (PB7) |
| Host control (roles, modes, moves, tuning) | ❌ | partial (macros) | ✅ **21 G-code commands** |
| Multi-lane | ❌ | ⚠️ manual macro work | ✅ N-scalable (`LANE=`) |
| One flash, all features | ❌ | — | ✅ runtime-toggleable |

---

## Architecture

Three stages, each optional beyond the first:

1. **MCU firmware task** (`src/buffer.c`) — the autonomous state machine (Mellow's logic ported verbatim) plus a command layer: **15 MCU commands / 5 response messages** (`lll_state`, `lll_ack`, `lll_event`, `lll_io`, `lll_io_ack`). The protocol block is shared byte-identically with the host extra. The file is *added* to the Klipper tree (modifies nothing) and survives `git pull`.
2. **Klipper host extra** (`klippy/extras/lll_buffer.py`) — one `[lll_buffer <lane>]` object per board: registers the **21 G-code commands** (per-lane mux by `LANE=`), exposes live state to macros via `printer["lll_buffer <lane>"]`, runs your `event_gcode` on every firmware event, and **persists + replays** roles/modes/enables/tweaks through `[save_variables]` at every connect.
3. **Web dashboard** (`dashboard/index.html`, optional) — a static page served by your existing nginx, talking to Moonraker's WebSocket, embedded in Mainsail as an iframe webcam card.

---

## How it works (the autonomous core)

A small Klipper MCU task (`src/buffer.c`, `DECL_INIT` + `DECL_TASK`) ports the state machine of Mellow's open firmware ([Fly3DTeam/Buffer](https://github.com/Fly3DTeam/Buffer)) and drives the on-board TMC2208 over its single-wire UART (`VACTUAL` velocity mode):

```
HALL3 (PB4) blocked  → motor FORWARD (push filament)
HALL2 (PB3) blocked  → motor STOP
HALL1 (PB2) blocked  → motor BACK (retract)
ENDSTOP_3 (PB7) = no filament → STOP   (+ host can pause the print)
```

Photo-sensor convention is taken **verbatim** from the source: *blocked = 1, clear = 0*. Manual **feed/retract buttons** (KEY1/KEY2) and the **mainboard control signals** (PB5/PB6, active-low) are supported too (both runtime-toggleable). A 60 s continuous-feed timeout acts as a jam safety; a matching 60 s back-timeout guards rewinds. Error codes (`ecode`) a lane can latch: `none`, `feed_timeout`, `back_timeout`, `diag_fault`, `host_alive`, `clear_pending` — reported by `LLL_QUERY` and pushed as `lll_event`.

### Pins (STM32F072CB)

| Function | Pin | Function | Pin |
|---|---|---|---|
| HALL1 | PB2 | KEY1 (retract) | PB13 |
| HALL2 | PB3 | KEY2 (feed) | PB12 |
| HALL3 | PB4 | FRONT signal | PB5 |
| Entrance switch | PB7 | BACK signal | PB6 |
| TMC EN | PA6 | TMC UART | PB1 |
| TMC DIAG | PB0 | LEDs | PA8 / PA15 |

Spare I/O (IOEXT channels): PA4, PA5, PB10, PB11, PA2, PA3, plus bench-gated LED/ADC pins. USB, SWD, TMC UART, halls, PB7, buttons and the 5 V headers are **outside** the IOEXT table by construction.

---

## Safety hardening

Nine fixes, **all present in the shipped code**:

1. `sched_is_shutdown()` guard as the **literal first line** of the buffer task, plus a `DECL_SHUTDOWN` handler that drives the motor enable high. **Bench-proven:** an `M112` fired in the middle of a commanded `LLL_RUN` cuts the motor dead.
2. **Single-writer**: command handlers set flags only — only the task and the shutdown handler ever touch EN/UART.
3. A forward run requires `present && !error`, re-checked **every tick**; backward runs stay allowed on runout (legitimate unload).
4. `back_timeout` (default 60 s) on parked follow and commanded back runs.
5. Critical pins (5 V headers PB8/PB9, host lines PB14/PB15, USB, SWD, TMC UART, halls, PB7, buttons) are **outside the IOEXT table** — index-only addressing makes them unreachable, not merely forbidden.
6. Every stop writes `VACTUAL=0` **before** re-asserting enable; every motion rewrites GCONF+VACTUAL.
7. Roles / modes / enables / tweaks are replayed in Klipper's **config sequence** (before `ready`) — `role: parked` closes the startup window on Klipper restarts.
8. **No UART bit-bang inside command handlers**; runtime TMC writes are deferred and spaced inside the task.
9. **Boot grace period**: after a hard MCU reset (`FIRMWARE_RESTART`, `M112`, power-cycle), no autonomous feed starts until the host has spoken once (20 s cap) — closes the phantom-push window of the compiled defaults; the done-latch is evaluated every tick so the grace can never re-arm (timer wrap included). **Field-proven:** `FIRMWARE_RESTART` with a fully-tensioned arm → zero motion. See [Known behaviour](#known-behaviour--limitations) for the deliberate standalone trade-off.

## Host G-code commands

All commands take `LANE=<lane>` (the `[lll_buffer <lane>]` section name), except `LLL_DETECT_LOADED` which is global.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `LLL_QUERY` | Full state report: role, mode, error/ecode, feeding, running, arm position, filament present, diag, cfgerr |
| `LLL_ROLE` | Set lane role `active` / `parked` / `standby` (persistent) |
| `LLL_SET_IDLE` | Backwards-compat alias (`VALUE=1` → parked, `0` → active) |
| `LLL_MODE` | Set FEED automation level `auto` / `semi_auto` / `semi_manual` / `manual` |
| `LLL_ARM` | Arm exactly one feed cycle (semi_auto mode) |
| `LLL_ENABLE` | Toggle one of the 11 functions at runtime |
| `LLL_SET` | Set a runtime parameter (timeouts, TMC current/microsteps/stealth, run limits, telemetry mask…) — persisted |
| `LLL_JOG` | Bounded jog `fwd` / `back` / `stop`, clamped to 10 s |
| `LLL_RUN` | Bounded run with deadline (`MS=0` → `run_max_ms`), refreshable |
| `LLL_STOP` | Stop host-commanded motion (autonomous behaviour resumes) |
| `LLL_CLEAR_ERROR` | Clear a latched jam/error (refused while a driver fault is still asserted) |
| `LLL_PROFILE_SAVE` | Save current tweaks as a named profile |
| `LLL_PROFILE_LOAD` | Apply a named profile (persists as current) |
| `LLL_PROFILE_LIST` | List saved profiles |
| `LLL_PROFILE_DELETE` | Delete a named profile |
| `LLL_FILAMENT` | Register the filament loaded on this lane (`TYPE=`, `COLOR=`, `TEMP=`, `SPOOL_ID=` for Spoolman) |
| `LLL_UNLOCK` | Unlock unverified IOEXT pins for the session (`KEY=0xDEB1`) |
| `LLL_IO_CFG` | Configure an IOEXT channel (din / dout / soft-PWM / ADC / release) |
| `LLL_IO_WRITE` | Write an IOEXT dout / PWM duty |
| `LLL_IO_READ` | Read an IOEXT channel |
| `LLL_DETECT_LOADED` | **Global**: probe which lane is physically loaded, using only the arm sensors (`EXPECTED=`, `ON_MISMATCH=warn\|pause\|error`) |

## Configuration

Start from **[config/printer.cfg.example](config/printer.cfg.example)** — one `[mcu]` + one `[lll_buffer]` pair per board:

```ini
[mcu LLL_PLUS]
serial: /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_stm32f072xb_XXXXXXXXXXXX-if00
restart_method: command

[save_variables]
filename: ~/printer_data/variables.cfg

[lll_buffer lll]
mcu: LLL_PLUS
role: parked
```

Two things matter:

- **`role: parked` is the recommended startup role.** The compiled-in default is `active`/`auto` ("keep buffering" even with no host), so there is a short window at startup where the board could push filament before Klipper's config arrives. `role: parked` closes that window for **Klipper restarts** (the role is replayed in the config sequence, before `ready`). Activate the lane you actually print with afterwards: `LLL_ROLE LANE=lll ROLE=active`. See [Known behaviour](#known-behaviour--limitations) for the hard-MCU-reset case.
- **`[save_variables]` is required for persistence.** Roles, modes, enables, `LLL_SET` tweaks, profiles and filament declarations are stored there and **replayed to the board at every connect** — your tuning survives restarts and re-flashes.

Optional section options: `feed_mode:` (startup automation level), `enable:` / `disable:` (force functions on/off from config), `poll_interval:` (state refresh, default 1.5 s), and `event_gcode:` (a Jinja template run on **every** event the board pushes — e.g. `PAUSE` on a jam within ~20–50 ms).

The entrance sensor can still pause the print the classic way — it is exposed as a normal MCU pin:

```ini
[filament_switch_sensor lll_entrance]
switch_pin: ^!LLL_PLUS:PB7
pause_on_runout: True
```

---

## Dashboard & UI

An optional, self-contained control panel (`dashboard/index.html`) displayed **inside Mainsail** as an interactive iframe webcam card. No Mainsail fork, no plugin, no extra service — one static file served by the nginx you already have:

```nginx
location /lll/ { alias /home/pi/lll_dashboard/; index index.html; add_header Cache-Control "no-store"; }
```

- Talks to Moonraker over its WebSocket through Mainsail's existing proxy — same origin, **zero CORS configuration**.
- **Auto-discovers every lane**: declare a new `[lll_buffer <lane>]` and its card appears by itself.
- **VCR-style transport** per lane: **hold** = jog, **double-click** = continuous, **single click** = stop. Continuous mode is a stream of **10-second-bounded orders refreshed every 3 s** — the page never sends an unbounded command, so if the browser dies mid-run the motor stops on its own in under 10 s.
- **Feed-gate aware** (v1.0.2): the footer always shows *active lane · loaded lane*; when the safety gate freezes a lane (selected while a different one is still physically loaded), its card shows a **frozen badge** and a one-click **unfreeze** (deliberate override: reset the loaded-lane memory and re-arm). A header **filament check** button runs `LLL_DETECT_LOADED` on demand.
- **Language follows Mainsail's own setting** (read from the Moonraker database), falling back to the browser language. English and French bundled.
- **Spoolman** (optional): run Spoolman as its own service (port 7912), add `[spoolman]` with `server: http://localhost:7912` / `sync_rate: 5` to `moonraker.conf` → Mainsail's native spool panel appears, and `LLL_FILAMENT ... SPOOL_ID=` links a lane to a spool. **When a lane becomes active, its spool becomes Moonraker's active spool** — per-spool usage tracking follows the lane.
- **LCD menu** (optional): [config/lcd_menu_lll.cfg.example](config/lcd_menu_lll.cfg.example) for a BTT MINI12864 — per-lane state + Activate / Park / Clear error. Safe manual-rewind workflow: **Park → physical buttons → Activate** (a parked lane never re-feeds forward under you).

Full walkthrough: **[dashboard/INSTALL.md](dashboard/INSTALL.md)**.

## Installation

> Done from your Klipper host (e.g. a Raspberry Pi). Commands assume `~/klipper` and `~/katapult` ([Arksine/katapult](https://github.com/Arksine/katapult)) are cloned, the Klipper build toolchain is installed, and `dfu-util` is available (`sudo apt install dfu-util`).
>
> No usable BOOT/RESET buttons on your unit? See the companion guide: [LLL-Plus-Katapult-NoDFU](https://github.com/Nitrooxyde/LLL-Plus-Katapult-NoDFU).

### Step 0 — Find your buffer & power it

Connect the buffer's USB to the host **and** give it **24 V on VIN** (the motor needs it; the firmware configures the TMC at first boot, so 24 V must be present then). List USB serial devices to identify the board and note your **unique chip ID** (you'll reuse it in `printer.cfg`):

```bash
ls /dev/serial/by-id/
# e.g. usb-Klipper_stm32f072xb_3C003A...3720-if00   (or a Mellow / katapult id)
#                            └──────── your XXXXXX ────────┘
```

### Step 1 — Enter DFU mode (to install Katapult)

On the buffer board: **hold BOOT**, tap **RESET**, release **RESET**, then release **BOOT**. Confirm with `sudo dfu-util -l` → `Found DFU: [0483:df11] ... name="@Internal Flash  /0x08000000/064*0002Kg"`.

### Step 2 — Back up the existing firmware (recommended)

```bash
sudo dfu-util -a 0 -d 0483:df11 -U ~/lll_backup_flash.bin       -s 0x08000000:0x20000
sudo dfu-util -a 1 -d 0483:df11 -U ~/lll_backup_optionbytes.bin            # option bytes
```

### Step 3 — Build & flash Katapult (one-time bootloader)

Katapult lets you flash all **future** updates over USB without opening the case.

```bash
cd ~/katapult
make menuconfig
```

- Micro-controller Architecture: **STMicroelectronics STM32**
- Processor model: **STM32F072**
- Clock Reference: **8 MHz crystal**
- Communication interface: **USB (on PA11/PA12)**
- Application start offset: **8 KiB**
- Support bootloader entry on rapid double click of reset: **OFF** ⚠️ *(the board **does** have BOOT/RESET buttons — that's how you entered DFU in Step 1 — but double-click-reset bootloader entry is **not reliable on this board**, and leaving this ON makes it fail to enumerate. It isn't needed anyway: normal bootloader entry is done over USB — `flashtool.py -r`, done automatically when flashing.)*

```bash
make clean && make
# board still in DFU (Step 1); flash with mass-erase so no stale app remains:
sudo dfu-util -a 0 -d 0483:df11 -D out/katapult.bin -s 0x08000000:force:mass-erase:leave
```

Re-plug USB and confirm Katapult enumerates: `ls /dev/serial/by-id/` → `usb-katapult_stm32f072xb_XXXXXX-if00`.

### Step 4 — Get this repository

Clone this repo onto the host (all following steps reference it by absolute path — you are still in `~/katapult` at this point, so relative paths would break):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nitrooxyde/Mellow-LLL-Plus-Canonical.git ~/lll-firmware
cd ~/lll-firmware
```

### Step 5 — Add this firmware to Klipper

Two files — the MCU task **and** the host extra:

```bash
cp ~/lll-firmware/src/buffer.c ~/klipper/src/buffer.c
cp ~/lll-firmware/klippy/extras/lll_buffer.py ~/klipper/klippy/extras/lll_buffer.py
```

Add **one line** to `~/klipper/src/Makefile` (only compiled for the F072 buffer, never for your main board):

```make
src-$(CONFIG_MACH_STM32F072) += buffer.c
```

> ⚠️ This Makefile line is reverted by `git pull` on the Klipper tree — re-add it after updating Klipper. `buffer.c` and `lll_buffer.py` themselves are untracked and survive.

### Step 6 — Build Klipper

> ⚠️ `make menuconfig` overwrites `~/klipper/.config`. If you build other MCUs (your main board, toolhead…) from this same tree, **back up its config first** and restore it afterwards:
> ```bash
> cp ~/klipper/.config ~/klipper/.config.mainboard   # backup
> # ...build & flash the buffer...
> cp ~/klipper/.config.mainboard ~/klipper/.config    # restore later
> ```

The exact build configuration used for the shipped binary is provided as **[build/klipper.config](build/klipper.config)** — you can copy it straight in:

```bash
cp ~/lll-firmware/build/klipper.config ~/klipper/.config
cd ~/klipper && make olddefconfig     # or: make menuconfig and verify
```

Or set it manually via `make menuconfig`: **STMicroelectronics STM32** → **STM32F072** → Bootloader offset **8 KiB bootloader** *(must match Katapult — application address `0x8002000`)* → Clock Reference **8 MHz crystal** → Communication interface **USB (on PA11/PA12)**.

```bash
make clean && make
```

### Step 7 — Flash over USB (via Katapult)

```bash
~/klippy-env/bin/python3 ~/katapult/scripts/flashtool.py \
  -f ~/klipper/out/klipper.bin \
  -d /dev/serial/by-id/usb-katapult_stm32f072xb_XXXXXX-if00
```

> Use the **klippy-env** Python — it has `pyserial` (the system Python usually doesn't). After flashing, the board re-enumerates as `usb-Klipper_stm32f072xb_XXXXXX-if00`.

### Step 8 — printer.cfg

Follow [Configuration](#configuration) / [config/printer.cfg.example](config/printer.cfg.example), then `FIRMWARE_RESTART`.

**No motor/stepper/TMC section** — the firmware owns the motor; the host talks to it through `[lll_buffer]`.

---

## Prebuilt binary

If you'd rather not build, the repo ships the **exact binary running in production on the reference setup**: [`build/klipper_canonical_v1_fix9.bin`](build/klipper_canonical_v1_fix9.bin) (53 824 bytes), built from Klipper `v0.13.0-700` (commit `d6ea62542`), build `20260705_234145`, config = [`build/klipper.config`](build/klipper.config). It is the canonical firmware including safety fix #9 (boot grace period).

SHA-256: `9239bdc367096438e72528d361f75f1ebb811784698cb0872ca79b2410837944`

```bash
sha256sum ~/lll-firmware/build/klipper_canonical_v1_fix9.bin    # verify before flashing
~/klippy-env/bin/python3 ~/katapult/scripts/flashtool.py \
  -f ~/lll-firmware/build/klipper_canonical_v1_fix9.bin \
  -d /dev/serial/by-id/usb-katapult_stm32f072xb_XXXXXX-if00
```

Building from source (Steps 4–7) remains the clean path — it guarantees your `klippy` host version and the MCU firmware come from the same tree.

## Updating later (no case opening)

> ⚠️ Same multi-MCU warning as Step 6: if you build other MCUs from this Klipper tree, `~/klipper/.config` may currently target your **main board** — building with it and flashing the result to the buffer would flash the **wrong binary**. Re-copy the buffer config (or verify via `make menuconfig` that `.config` targets the STM32F072) before building.

```bash
[ -f ~/klipper/.config ] && cp ~/klipper/.config ~/klipper/.config.pre_lll   # backup whatever was there
cp ~/lll-firmware/build/klipper.config ~/klipper/.config   # make sure the build targets the buffer (STM32F072)
cd ~/klipper && make olddefconfig
make clean && make          # (re-add the Makefile line if a git pull removed it)
~/klippy-env/bin/python3 ~/katapult/scripts/flashtool.py \
  -f ~/klipper/out/klipper.bin \
  -d /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_stm32f072xb_XXXXXX-if00
# then FIRMWARE_RESTART
```

`flashtool` reboots the running app into Katapult over USB automatically — you can target the **Klipper** serial directly, no buttons. The bundled helper automates the whole flash (bootloader request, wait, flash, wait for re-enumeration): `bash ~/lll-firmware/scripts/flash_lll.sh <chip-serial>` — one board at a time, flashes `~/klipper/out/klipper.bin`.

## TMC2208 register values

Derived directly from Mellow's firmware parameters (via the `TMCStepper` library it uses), not guessed:

| Register | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| GCONF | `0x000001C4` | spreadCycle, pdn_disable, mstep_reg_select (shaft bit set for FORWARD) |
| CHOPCONF | `0x12020055` | toff=5, vsense, 64 µsteps, intpol |
| IHOLD_IRUN | `0x00010F07` | IRUN=15, IHOLD=7 (≈ `rms_current(500)` @ Rsense 0.11) |
| PWMCONF | `0xC10D0024` | pwm_autoscale |
| VACTUAL | `77575` | 260 rpm, 64 µsteps |

With the canonical firmware you no longer need to edit the source to tune these: `LLL_SET LANE=... PARAM=...` changes current (IRUN/IHOLD), microsteps, stealthChop, standstill mode, TPOWERDOWN and the VACTUAL magnitude at runtime — persisted and replayed at boot. Bounds are clamped to the deployed known-good values; don't raise the current without your motor's datasheet.

## Known behaviour & limitations

### Mainsail shows MCU load ~100 % (false positive)

Once this firmware is running, Mainsail's **MCU Load** bar for the LLL Plus may read **~100 %**. **This is a false positive — the MCU is not overloaded.**

The auto-feed task bit-bangs the TMC2208 `VACTUAL` value over a software UART. Each update is a short, tightly-timed burst (~8 ms), which inflates the per-task timing **standard deviation** that Mainsail's load indicator is built on — even though the MCU is idle the vast majority of the time.

Measured over a full print (`klippy.log` / MCU stats):

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `mcu_awake` | ~0.03–0.06 | awake only **~3–6 %** of the time |
| `mcu_task_avg` | ~0.4 ms | tasks are short |
| `mcu_task_stddev` | ~2.5 ms | spikes from the bit-bang `VACTUAL` bursts (~8 ms) — this is what drives the "100 %" bar |
| `send_seq` vs `receive_seq` | equal | no command backlog |
| retransmits | a few bytes over a whole print | link healthy |
| "Timer too close" / shutdowns | **0** | no real overload |

**Conclusion:** display artifact of the bit-bang timing jitter. Auto-feed, buttons and runout all keep working normally — no action needed.

### Feed dead band between the STOP and PUSH hall zones (by design)

The state machine — identical to Mellow's standalone, all versions — starts a feed **only when the tension arm reaches the hall3 (push) position** and stops it at hall2 (balanced). Between the two there is a dead band (**~13 mm of filament on the reference setup**) during which the extruder pulls against the buffer alone until the arm travels back to hall3. This is inherent to the three-sensor design, not a fault; it matters if you're diagnosing brief tension rises right after a feed cycle ends.

### Startup after a hard MCU reset — fixed by the boot grace period (fix #9)

The compiled-in defaults are `active` / `auto` (deliberate: a board that loses its host **keeps buffering**). After a **hard MCU reset** (`FIRMWARE_RESTART`, an `M112` emergency stop, or a power-cycle) the task runs on those defaults before Klipper's config arrives — on earlier builds this caused a brief phantom filament push whenever the tension arm was loaded. **The shipped firmware closes this**: no autonomous step-9 motion (forward feed or active-role back-follow) starts until the host has spoken once, capped at 20 s. Buttons, jog, run, roles and the parked follow stay live during the grace. Field-proven on the reference setup: `FIRMWARE_RESTART` with a fully-tensioned arm → zero motion, arm position unchanged.

Two honest notes:
- **Deliberate standalone trade-off, not Mellow parity**: a board that is *never* host-driven starts auto-feeding 20 s after power-on, where Mellow's stock standalone firmware starts ~1 s after boot. That one-time latency is the price of closing the post-reset push.
- `role: parked` in printer.cfg remains recommended as a complementary layer (it also covers the case of a Klipper host that stays down longer than 20 s with a tensioned arm).

---

## Field validation status

Honest scope of what has been tested:

- **One reference setup**: a single printer, **two LLL Plus boards** (two lanes), STM32F072CB.
- The shipped binary has been running **in production** on both boards since its build date, through **multiple real multi-day prints including filament color changes**.
- **Bench-tested module by module**: roles, modes, enables, bounded jog/run, error latch/clear, IOEXT gating, telemetry events, profile persistence, and the `M112` shutdown kill.
- **Not exercised on this setup** (no hardware/wiring to trigger them): mainboard signal control (PB5/PB6) beyond bench checks, and non-default IOEXT wiring on the spare headers.
- **No other board revision or hardware combination has been tested.** Pins and register values are specific to this board.

## Host macros (example)

**[config/lll_macros.cfg.example](config/lll_macros.cfg.example)** ships the multi-lane orchestration layer used on the reference setup: `SET_ACTIVE_LANE`, `_LLL_INIT`, the `Tn` / `_COLOR_CHANGE` tool-change entry points, `LLL_PANEL`, and friends. It is the layer the dashboard and the command manuals refer to. Copy it into your `printer.cfg` (or `[include]` it) and adapt lane names, temperatures and purge values to your machine.

Since **v1.0.2** this layer ships a **feed-gate**: `SET_ACTIVE_LANE` never arms a lane's autonomous feed while a *different* lane is physically loaded (`lll_loaded_lane` memory, written by `LLL_DETECT_LOADED`), with automatic re-arm during a swap once the old filament has left the extruder entry — see the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for the field incident behind it.

## Multicolor / automatic filament change — status

On the reference setup, filament color changes are done **manually**: there is no automatic cutter and no passive respoolers, so a human swaps the filament at the `Tn` pause. A complete automatic pipeline (unload / load / resume orchestration) was prototyped and did work, but it is **not shipped** in this repo. Full, honest breakdown of what works, what was prototyped and what is missing: **[docs/MULTICOLOR_STATUS.en.md](docs/MULTICOLOR_STATUS.en.md)** (English) · **[docs/MULTICOLOR_STATUS.fr.md](docs/MULTICOLOR_STATUS.fr.md)** (French).

## Experimental: Phase C (v1.1) — informational only

The **[experimental/phase-c/](experimental/phase-c/README.md)** folder exposes, purely for information and **without any official status**, a 46-line evolution of the firmware: a grace period at boot plus an optional `rewind_pause` behaviour. It was written, reviewed, flashed and bench-tested — then **withdrawn from the reference setup**: the `rewind_pause` option proved dangerous on a lane actively printing. Since then, **its grace-period half has been re-derived, hardened (tick-level done-latch) and integrated into the official firmware as safety fix #9** — what remains specific to this folder is the `rewind_pause` story. It is provided as-is for feedback and testing by people who know what they are doing; it is **not** what the shipped binary contains. Details, diff and post-mortem: [experimental/phase-c/README.md](experimental/phase-c/README.md).

## 🙏 We're asking for your feedback — it's what makes this evolve

This firmware has been validated on **one** setup. If you get the chance to
try it on yours, **please tell us how it went** — we are genuinely asking:

- **It misbehaved?** Open a [🐛 bug report](../../issues/new?template=bug_report.yml)
  — and give us as much detail as you can on **how the problem presented
  itself** (when, doing what, repeatable or not, `LLL_QUERY` output, log
  excerpt). That detail is exactly what lets us keep improving this repo.
- **It worked? Partially? Surprised you?** A [🧪 field test report](../../issues/new?template=test_report.yml)
  is just as valuable — successes from different setups tell us what is
  solid, failures tell us what to fix next.
- PRs welcome too, and general discussion lives in the
  [TeamFDM thread](https://www.teamfdm.com/forums/topic/7617-faster-printing-requiring-filament-buffer-feeding/)
  where this project took shape.

Don't hesitate — no report is too small, and none of them will be met with
anything but gratitude.

## Language note (upstream)

The shipped sources are **byte-identical** to the deployment validated in production on the reference setup — that is the core guarantee of this repo, backed by the published SHA-256 fingerprints. As a consequence, some runtime messages and code comments are in **French**. Translations are welcome as PRs, but be aware they would break the byte-for-byte identity with the deployed code — which is why the shipped files themselves are left untouched.

## Credits — who did what

This project did not start here, and it was not built by one pair of hands:

- **The idea comes from the community.** It grew out of many reads through the Voron community and the TeamFDM forums (notably [this buffer-feeding thread](https://www.teamfdm.com/forums/topic/7617-faster-printing-requiring-filament-buffer-feeding/)) and the research they pushed us into — that is what motivated this little project in the first place. [Fly3DTeam / Mellow](https://github.com/Fly3DTeam/Buffer) published the original FLY Buffer firmware & hardware (the autonomous state machine is ported from their open source); [river29](https://github.com/river29/Mellow-LLLBufferPLUS-klipper), [ss1gohan13](https://github.com/ss1gohan13/BufferPLUS-klipper) and [depau/lll-buffed](https://github.com/depau/lll-buffed) opened the Klipper road before us.
- **Constraints, resolutions and field testing — [Nitrooxyde](https://github.com/Nitrooxyde).** The design decisions under real-world constraints (USB-only, one board per lane, park-first safety, sensors at determined positions with measured distances) and every hour of bench and production validation on the reference setup.
- **Implementation — Claude (Anthropic's AI).** The firmware, the host extra, the dashboard and the documentation were written by Claude working in pair with Nitrooxyde — it is what made this project possible, and it is stated here openly (see also the `Co-Authored-By` in the commit history). We would rather say it upfront than have anyone feel misled.
- **[Klipper](https://github.com/Klipper3d/klipper)** — MCU firmware framework and host.
- **[Katapult](https://github.com/Arksine/katapult)** — USB bootloader. Install guide without opening the case: [LLL-Plus-Katapult-NoDFU](https://github.com/Nitrooxyde/LLL-Plus-Katapult-NoDFU).
